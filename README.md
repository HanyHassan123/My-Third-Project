##Features

Feature	Description

1-attack_source	Origin or initiator of the attack (e.g., botnet, malware, insider).
2-attack_type	Type of cyberattack (e.g., DDoS, phishing, ransomware).
3-country	Country where the attack was initiated or reported.
4-defence_mechanism	Method used to mitigate or respond to the attack.
5-financial_loss	Estimated monetary loss due to the attack (USD).
6-incident_resolution_time	Time taken to resolve the incident (in hours or days).
7-number_of_affected_user	Number of users impacted by the attack.
8-security_vulnerability_type	Vulnerability exploited (e.g., SQL injection, zero-day, misconfiguration).
9-target_industry	Industry affected (e.g., finance, healthcare, education).
10-year	Year of occurrence.
11-threats_level (Added)	Custom-calculated level of threat (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
12-attacks_per_country (Added)	Aggregated number of attacks per country.


##Use Cases

1-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2-Trend analysis of cybersecurity threats over the years

3-Predictive modeling of financial loss or resolution time

4-Clustering based on threat levels or regions

5-Visualization dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

6-Cybersecurity risk analysis

7-Data storytelling dashboards

8-Machine learning experiments (e.g., predicting financial loss)

9-Corporate threat profiling


##The dataset was cleaned and processed using Python, including:

1-Handling missing values

2-Feature engineering (threats_level, attacks_per_country)

3-Data type conversions

4-Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborn


##Visualization

The processed dataset was imported into Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. Key visuals included:

1-Threat distribution by country and industry

2-Yearly trends of attack types

3-Financial loss analysis per threat level

4-Top 10 vulnerable countries and industries




##Example Insights

1-Top 5 countries with the highest number of cyberattacks

2-Most common types of attacks in the finance industry

3-Correlation between threat level and financial loss

4-Year-over-year growth of ransomware attacks
